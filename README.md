This is a personal site that serves as a practice area for me to try different web development techniques and try to build things from scratch. Currently the content is some project writeups and some general web dev content to get me writing and thinking more about the web/software development world.

The Angular web framework is overkill for this application; I decided to build the site with Angular because it was a challenge, and I wanted to learn more about web framework models, typescript, node, routing etc.

The site is currently under construction, you can find upcoming improvements and features in this repo's issues tab.
