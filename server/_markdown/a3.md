## Information structuring
#### Planning and schema creation
Initially, we created user personas, use cases, and wireframes to focus the project scope and determine a structure for different information types. With these use cases in mind, we created our projectâ€™s XML schema. 

Our schema defined the different types of possible information that could be contained in the documents, the relationships of the different information types, and the allowed number of occurrences of every information type.

#### Custom XML
 
The information structure was then used to create an extensible markup language (XML) that was applied to the original content. Our group used XSL, a family of languages that allows users to navigate and transform XML documents, to generate our final documents.

## Document generation
#### Print document generation

After the XSL templates were created, we used XSL:FO, a specific transformation language that is used for creating page layouts with XML documents, to generate PDF documents. 

#### HTML document generation

To generate the HTML documents we used the same content and the same XML schema, but we applied a different transformation process that places the XML content into a HTML markup 'skeleton'.

## Website development

#### Wireframes

First we created desktop and mobile wireframes to plan and organize the different views of our website.

With the wireframes complete my team hosted our generated HTML documents, and styled our website elements to match the look of our wireframes.

#### AJAX

The website incorporates Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) in the navigation between categories and documents, which allows the website to only reload the parts of the webpage that need to change when a user switches documents or categories.

## Last Thoughts

 - The project was very process heavy&mdash;we spent most of our time planning and creating information structures so that we could streamline the process of publishing the documents.
 
 - This project was successful; because these PDF and HTML documents were generated using the same information schema and markup, the information contained within the documents was formatted consistently. This was a great improvement over the formatting of content in the original documents, and it creates a solid framework for continuing to create well-formatted documents.
