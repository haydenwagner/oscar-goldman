<!-- Title: slideswell -->
<!-- A good looking, small, pure JavaScript slider -->

<!--
Main Points
- The goal of this project is to create an aesthetic slider for desktop and mobile projects that are trying to avoid including jQuery as a dependency. 
- The slider supports click and touch events, and its appearance is modeled after the Spotify album slider.

## Surrounded by sliders
JavaScript sliders are everywhere&mdash;I found a ton of different options in the first few pages of a google search. Some of the more popular JS sliders are featured in the table below.

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead class="thead-default">
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Requires jQuery?</th>
      <th>File size\*</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="http://unslider.com/" target="_blank">Unslider</a></th>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>5.6kB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/" target="_blank">Slick</a></th>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>47kB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="http://supersimpleslider.com/" target="_blank">Super simple slider</a></th>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>&lt;1kB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="http://www.jssor.com/" target="_blank">Jssor</a></th>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>~50kB\*\*</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="http://idangero.us/swiper/" target="_blank">Swiper</a></th>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>113kB</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="small">
  \*The file size includes minified css files when applicable<br>

  \*\*Jssor has many different slider versions, this file size reflects the minified JS file size for their standard image slider.
</p>

For projects that require an extensive and customizable slider, one from the list above should fit your needs. My favorite is Slick if you are using jQuery already, but Swiper is ridiculous (in a good way) if you aren't using jQuery and want to make a wild slider.

## So why make another?

Why make another JS slider? Because **most available JS sliders are relatively large or require jQuery**&mdash;slideswell is different.
 
 - slideswell does not require jQuery required
 - slideswell is small (**10.2kb** for minified JS and CSS files in current release)
 - slideswell has animated images and a smooth presentation
 - slideswell supports mobile touch events
 
## Install code and example

The following code shows a simple HTML setup for slideswell. Link the JS and CSS, make a div with an ID that surrounds your images, and then pass that ID to a slideswell constructor.

     <html>
        <head>
            <title>Test slideswell</title>
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="slideswell.min.css">
        </head>
        <body>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="slideswell" id="testSlideswell">
                    <img src="test1.jpg"/>
                    <img src="test2.jpg"/>
                    <img src="test3.jpg"/>
                    <img src="test4.jpg"/>
                    <img src="test5.jpg"/>
                </div>
            </div>
    
            <script src="slideswell.min.js"></script>
            <script>
                new Slideswell("testSlideswell");
            </script>
        </body>
     </html>

<figure class="figure">
  <img src="../assets/temp/images/5/slideswell_close-crop.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded no-touch" alt="An example slideswell slider">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">A screenshot of an example slideswell slider</figcaption>
</figure>
-->
Here is the resulting slider:

<iframe width='100%' scrolling="no" onload="this.style.height=this.contentDocument.body.scrollHeight +'px';" src='../../assets/temp/images/6/index.html'></iframe>

<!--
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Note:</strong> I don't have an interactive slideswell example on this post yet, but <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/haydenwagner/raw/c23f63ad4c94622b14fdab9a62075d0b/" target="_blank">here you can view a simple demo</a> on the Gist hosting site 'bl.ocks.org'.

## Project inspiration
The slideswell slider's name and behavior are inspired by the Spotify image slider (it slides well, and the images 'swell' as they slide).

<figure class="figure">
  <img src="../assets/temp/images/5/spotify.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="slideswell inspiration: the spotify album slider">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">slideswell inspiration: the spotify album slider</figcaption>
</figure>

## Last thoughts
- I am aware that this is not revolutionary, but it can be useful for users who need a **simple, quick, and small slider while not sacrificing looks and performance**.
- I haven't focused on pairing down the code as much as possible yet&mdash;I believe can get the code much smaller.
- There are other similar projects, like <a href='http://www.menucool.com/javascript-image-slider' target="_blank">Menucool's pure JS slider @ 16kb</a>, but I believe the animation and feel of slideswell is different.
