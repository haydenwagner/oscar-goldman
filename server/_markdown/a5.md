<!-- Title: slide-swell -->
<!-- A good looking, small, pure JavaScript slider -->

<!--
Main Points
- The goal of this project is to create an aesthetic slider for desktop and mobile projects that are trying to avoid including jQuery as a dependency. 
- The slider supports click and touch events, and its appearance is modeled after the Spotify album slider.

### Surrounded by sliders
JavaScript sliders are everywhere&mdash;I found handfuls in the first few pages of a google search. Some of the more popular JS sliders are featured in the table below.

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead class="thead-default">
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Requires jQuery?</th>
      <th>File size\*</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="http://unslider.com/" target="_blank">Unslider</a></th>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>5.6kB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/" target="_blank">Slick</a></th>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>47kB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="http://supersimpleslider.com/" target="_blank">Super simple slider</a></th>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>&lt;1kB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="http://www.jssor.com/" target="_blank">Jssor</a></th>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>~50kB\*\*</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="http://idangero.us/swiper/" target="_blank">Swiper</a></th>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>113kB</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="small">

\*The file size includes minified css files when applicable<br>

\*\*Jssor has many different slider versions, this file size reflects the minified JS file size for their standard image slider.

</p>

For projects that require a complete and customizable slider, one from the list above should fit your needs. My favorite is Slick if you are using jQuery already, but Swiper is ridiculous (in a good way) if you aren't using jQuery and want to make a wild slider.

### So why make another?

Why make another JS slider? Because **most available JS sliders are relatively large or require jQuery**&mdash;slide-swell is different.
 
 - slide-swell does not require jQuery required
 - slide-swell is small (**10.2kb** for minified JS and CSS files in current release)
 - slide-swell has animated images and a smooth presentation 
 - slide-swell supports mobile touch events
 
### Install code and example

     <html>
        <head>
            <title>Test slide-swell</title>
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="slideSwell.min.css">
        </head>
        <body>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="slideSwell" id="testSlideSwell">
                    <img src="test1.jpg"/>
                    <img src="test2.jpg"/>
                    <img src="test3.jpg"/>
                </div>
            </div>
    
            <script src="slideSwell.min.js"></script>
            <script>
                new SlideSwell("testSlideSwell");
            </script>
        </body>
     </html>
     
<figure class="figure">
  <img src="../assets/temp/images/5/slide-swell.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded no-touch" alt="An example slide-swell slider">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">A screenshot of an example slide-swell slider</figcaption>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Note:</strong> I don't have an interactive slide-swell example on this post yet, but <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/haydenwagner/c23f63ad4c94622b14fdab9a62075d0b" target="_blank">here you can view a simple demo</a> on the Gist hosting site 'bl.ocks.org'.

### Project inspiration
The slide-swell slider's name and behavior are inspired by the Spotify image slider (it slides well, and the images 'swell' as they slide)

<figure class="figure">
  <img src="../assets/temp/images/5/spotify.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="slide-swell inspiration: the spotify album slider">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">slide-swell inspiration: the spotify album slider</figcaption>
</figure>



### Last thoughts
- I am aware that this is not revolutionary, but it can be useful for users who need a **simple, quick, and small slider while not sacrificing looks and performance**.
- I haven't focused on pairing down the code as much as possible yet&mdash;I believe can get the code much smaller.
- There are other similar projects, like <a href='http://www.menucool.com/javascript-image-slider' target="_blank">Menucool's pure JS slider @ 16kb</a>, but I believe the animation and feel of slide-swell is different.
