Title: Task request form integrated with Asana API
Preview: An application that improves the efficiency of a task submission and management system
Main Points:
- The client side of this app is a form that is customized to accept the many different task request types that may be made to our department.
- The form allows users and workers to quickly submit detailed task requests
- The front-end of the application is built primarily with HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap
- The back-end of this application uses Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io to integrate with the Asana API

        ## Project Description
        This project uses the Google Maps API, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to generate map points based on the location of School of Media Sciences student's past co-ops. Users can zoom in and access each point to see the different companies and corresponding industries of the companies at that point. Users can also apply a filter to narrow down the amount of map points and search for co-ops in a specific area.

        ## Approach

        ### Map Point Generation
        A JSON file holds the data for every location that will receive a map point.
        Each location has a longitude and latitude value which allows a point to be generated with the Google Maps API.

        <div class="div--image--tall">
          <img class="image image--tall" src="assets/projects/map/points-resampled2.jpg">
          <p class="description description--image description--image--tall">Map after initial point generation</p>
        </div>

        ### Point Interaction
        If a point is clicked the interface will zoom into that point, and information
        from the data file will be displayed. This information includes the name of this
        location and a list of co-op companies and their corresponding industries. Each
        name in the list is a link that will take the user to that company’s website, where
        they can learn more about the company or the co-op opportunities that the company offers.

        <div class="div--image--tall">
          <img class="image image--tall" src="assets/projects/map/info-resampled2.jpg">
          <p class="description description--image description--image--tall">Information displayed when user clicks a point</p>
        </div>

        ### Filter
        <p>Users can filter the map points by location (by states in the United States only), by
        industry, or by location and industry. Filter selections are saved if a filter has been applied,
        and a user cannot apply the same filter that is active. Users are notified if their filter
        will return no results, and they can select “All Map Points” to see all of the original map points.</p>

        <div class="div--image--tall">
          <img class="image image--tall" src="assets/projects/map/filter-resampled2.jpg">
          <p class="description description--image description--image--tall">Map filter interface with selections highlighted</p>
        </div>

        ## Challenges
        The biggest challenge in this project was the filter functions. The logic to combine
        location and industry filters and to update the filter selections of the user in real time
        is difficult. I had to break down my functions into smaller pieces that I could understand
        completely before I solved the problems I was having with the filter logic.


        ## Summary
        This project involved a great deal of researching and learning new JavaScript techniques. I learned how to
        read and use the Google Maps API (which is pretty straightforward), and I ended up with an interactive map that I believe is useable and looks good.

        With some minor improvements (mentioned below in the future improvements section below)
        this project could become an interesting visual tool for students.

        </a>

        ## Future Improvements
        - The industry filter only filters complete map points; it doesn’t filter the companies that are shown at a map point. The filter logic could be more complete to filter the companies shown at the map points.
         - Clicking a map point shows a list of co-op companies, with links to the companies' websites. Ideally we should include the companies' information in the display so that a user can learn about the companies while staying in the application.
         - Currently the co-op data is stored in a local JSON file. The data should be moved into a database so that it can be easily edited and maintained.
