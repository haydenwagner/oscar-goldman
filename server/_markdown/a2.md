<!--Using Git Bash in the native Webstorm terminal (Windows)-->

## WebStorm terminal settings
In WebStorm you can find the terminal settings under <samp>File/Settings/Terminal</samp> in the WebStorm interface. Here you can
change the 'shell path' setting to change the shell in the integrated terminal.

## WebStorm default terminal shell path
Shell path: <kbd>cmd.exe</kbd>

This is the default terminal shell in WebStorm(the windows command line shell). I wanted to get this same behavior in WebStorm with the git-bash shell.

## Change terminal shell path to git-bash exe (not quite)
Shell path: <kbd>C:\Program Files\Git\git-bash.exe</kbd>

When I first tried to get the git-bash shell working in the WebStorm terminal this is the path I tried; this path does 
start a git-bash shell, but it opens in a new window and is not integrated in the terminal.

## Change terminal shell path to git shell exe 
Shell path: <kbd>C:\Program Files\Git\bin\sh.exe</kbd>

Here is the path that gave me exactly what I was looking for&mdash;with this terminal shell path WebStorm will open a new 
integrated terminal tab running the git-bash shell.

<mark>This is great for windows developers who use a bash shell because they can use the bash commands that they are familiar with while
benefiting from the efficiency of an integrated terminal.</mark>

The efficiency is noticeable when you use multiple bash shells, as they are all organized as tabs inside the WebStorm terminal tool, instead of separate git-bash windows.
