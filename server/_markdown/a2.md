<!--Using Git Bash in the native Webstorm terminal (Windows)-->

Intro
I got used to working with a set of commands that are different between bash and the windows command line (ex. 'dir' to show current directory on windows is 'ls' in bash)

### 1 - Webstorm default
setting: cmd.exe

![Default terminal](../assets/temp/images/1_terminal-default-windows.jpg "Terminal with default Webstorm settings (windows)")
result (pic 1)



### 2 - Change terminal setting to git-bash executable (still wrong)

setting: C:\Program Files\Git\git-bash.exe

Result: (pic 2)

### 1 - Webstorm default

setting: C:\Program Files\Git\bin\sh.exe

Command executes the shell that would be executed in the git-bash program, but it doesn't open up a new git-bash window. 

Result: (pic 3)

Type all the same commands that you are used to with git-bash, all inside of the webstorm IDE. This means you don't have to switch
out of your IDE to run bash commands, and with Webstorm you can open multiple shells as tabs within the terminal interface.
