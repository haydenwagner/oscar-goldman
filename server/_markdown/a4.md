## Project approach
 
My project team beta tested Adobe's new digital publishing beta: Adobe Experience Manager—Mobile. This software moves away from monthly digital publication releases towards constantly updating content to encourage a higher level of user interaction with applications.
 
The articles for the application were either static or interactive; the static articles were InDesign documents, and the interactive articles were web pages.

## Interactive articles
As the "technical lead" of this project I was responsible for creating and testing interactive content, and handling app settings, layout, and distribution.

Interactive articles for the app were created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure proper device resizing and a high level of user interaction. Adobe's software allowed me to directly publish these html articles to our application.

### Co-op map
The co-op map is an interactive article I made that uses the Google Maps API and JavaScript to display the locations of student’s co-op companies. Clicking the map points shows more details about the companies in that location. The map features a filter function that allows the user to filter the points on the map by location and industry.

### Co-op industry visualization donut graph
The Co-op Industry donut graph is an interactive article I made in which users touch sections of a "donut" graph to see what percentage of our students get co-ops in that industry.

This article uses JavaScript and D3.js to create the animations that occur when a user interacts with the graph. If the user chooses an industry that is related to another app story, the article will display a link to that story at the bottom of the page (shown at the end of the .gif below).

## App management
I managed the app submission and distribution processes through the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store; most of this work was figuring out how to create different certificates and meet other requirements that Apple has for apps on their store.

### Download the App for iOS or Android

  <p><strong>Alert</strong>: I have moved on from this position, and I believe the app is not being managed or updated anymore.</p>
  
  <p>You can still find the app with the links below; however, I don't know if it will have any recently added content or be fully operational.</p>
