<!-- Title: School of Media Sciences App -->
<!-- A digital publishing app I worked on in a co-op position at the Rochester Institute of Technology. The app features interactive articles and was made with an experimental Adobe publishing framework.-->

<!--
Main Points
- I worked on this project over a ten week period with another student; we were advised by two of our professors from our program. 
- Our main goal was to create an interactive application, using new Adobe software, that showcased the School of Media Sciences at RIT to potential students, current students, and alumni.

## App interface examples
Shown below are examples of the most recent versions of the app’s home screen and article design on different devices.

## Project approach
 
My project team beta tested Adobe's new digital publishing beta: Adobe Experience Manager—Mobile. This software moves away from monthly digital publication releases towards fluid, constantly updating content with a higher level of user interaction.
 
The articles for the application were either static or interactive; the static articles were InDesign documents, and the interactive articles were web pages.

### Interactive articles
As the "technical lead" of this project I was responsible for creating and testing interactive content, and handling app settings, layout, and distribution.

Interactive articles for the app were created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure proper device resizing and a high level of user interaction. Adobe's software allowed me to directly publish these html articles to our application.

#### Co-op map
The co-op map is an interactive article I made that uses the Google Maps API and JavaScript to display the locations of student’s co-op companies. Clicking the map points shows more details about the companies in that location. The map features a filter function that allows the user to filter the points on the map by location and industry.

#### Co-op industry visualization donut graph
The Co-op Industry donut graph is an interactive article I made in which users touch sections of a "donut" graph to see what percentage of our students get co-ops in that industry.

This article uses JavaScript and D3.js to create the animations that occur when a user interacts with the graph. If the user chooses an industry that is related to another app story, the article will display a link to that story at the bottom of the page (shown at the end of the .gif below).

## App store logistics
It was also my job to manage the app submission and distribution processes through the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. It's actually kind of hard! Managing the different licenses and certs you need to actually publish apps is pretty confusing if you are doing it for the first time. We worked it out eventually, but getting the iOS certs correct on a work computer took a while.

 <h2>Download the App for iOS or Android</h2>

  <p><strong>Alert</strong>: I have moved on from this position, and I believe the app is not being managed or updated anymore. That is the nature of projects that are developed by students and teams that eventually must graduate.</p> 
  
  <p>You can still find the app with the links below; however, I don't know if it will be fully operational.</p>
