Main Points:
- Building this website with Angular is overkill
- The content is currently not ground-breaking
- They serve a purpose for me to learn and improve as a writer and developer
-->

The purposes of this website are to give me practice with Angular 2, and to get me writing and thinking more about the web/software development world.

**The Angular web framework is overkill for this application**. A simple webpage would load the content I have here with zero wait time, and it wouldn’t have any impact on the current usability of the site. I decided to build the site with Angular because it was a challenge, and I wanted to learn more about web framework models, typescript, node, routing etc.

Lately I have been looking at the <a href="http://emberjs.com" target="_blank">Ember.js framework</a> quite a bit, and I believe that it would be a better fit for this project. In the future I may keep this Angular site as a Github repo, and simplify the production site by switching to the Ember.js framework.

**The world doesn’t really need another developer making useless posts**. Currently the posts here give me content to manage and present on this site, and gets me writing and thinking about the development industry. In the future, hopefully, I can offer something unique that won’t add to the clutter on the internet.

The site is currently under construction, you can find upcoming improvements and features in the <a href="https://github.com/haydenwagner/oscar-goldman/issues" target="_blank">project repo's issues</a>.
