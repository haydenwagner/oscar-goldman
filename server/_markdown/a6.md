Main Points:
- This website construction is a bit ridiculous
- The content is currently not ground-breaking
- They serve a purpose for me to learn and improve as a developer
-->

The purposes of this website are to give me practice with Angular 2, and to get me writing and thinking more about the web/software development world.

1. **I am aware that using the Angular web framework is ridiculous for this application**. A simple webpage would load the content I have here with zero wait time, and it wouldn’t have any impact on the current usability of the site. But that doesn’t teach me anything about Angular, web framework models, typescript, node, routing etc. So here it is, and it’s built with Angular.

2. **I am aware that the world doesn’t really need another web dev making useless posts**. Currently the posts here give me content to manage and present on this site, and get me writing and thinking about the development industry. In the future, hopefully, I can offer something unique that won’t add to the clutter on the internet.

I will continue to add features and refine the site until it is worth of being built with a web framework-right now it is probably bloated and misconfigured and overcomplicated, **but it serves a purpose for me**.
