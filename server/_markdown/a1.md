### Swipe Movement
When a user swipes the slider the “left” property of a div that holds the images is adjusted, so that the images appear to move with the user’s finger. After the used releases their finger the holder div is centered on the closest image, meaning that if the user swipes further than the halfway point between the current image and the next image then the slider will move to the next image.
 
### Cycle Buttons
Buttons are offered to the user to cycle the images if they are on desktop or do not want to swipe between images. If a button is tapped or clicked the holder div will move so that the next image in that button’s direction is centered. The corresponding button will disappear if the current image is at the beginning or end of the available images.

### Conclusion
This slider is an improvement on my first image slider because it is more visually appealing and it allows mobile users to swipe between images.

**Additionally, multiple image sliders can be easily added to any webpage, and captions can be added to the images (shown below).**
