After the used releases their finger the holder div is centered on the closest image, meaning that if the user swipes further than the halfway point between the current image and the next image then the slider will move to the next image.</p>\n\n<h3>Cycle Buttons</h3>\n\n<p>Buttons are offered to the user to cycle the images if they are on desktop or do not want to swipe between images. If a button is tapped or clicked the holder div will move so that the next image in that button’s direction is centered. The corresponding button will disappear if the current image is at the beginning or end of the available images.</p>\n\n<p>````\n     this si code and this is the code block and how it \n     will look when it is       </p>\n\n<pre><code> indented\n\n dlkjkkldjasldfdsafsdfdas\n shit this is not working\n back to this line lets try it\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>````</p>\n\n<p><em>test italic shit this italic test is really nice maybe</em></p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>This slider is an improvement on my first image slider because it is more visually appealing and it allows mobile users to swipe between images.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additionally, multiple image sliders can be easily added to any webpage, and captions can be added to the images (shown below).</strong>  </p>"

This software moves away from monthly digital publication releases towards fluid, constantly updating content with a higher level of user interaction.</p>\n\n<p>The articles for the application were either static or interactive; the static articles were InDesign documents, and the interactive articles were web pages.</p>\n\n<h3>Interactive articles</h3>\n\n<p>As the \"technical lead\" of this project I was responsible for creating and testing interactive content, and handling app settings, layout, and distribution.</p>\n\n<p>Interactive articles for the app were created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure proper device resizing and a high level of user interaction. Adobe's software allowed me to directly publish these html articles to our application.</p>\n\n<h4>Co-op map</h4>\n\n<p>The co-op map is an interactive article I made that uses the Google Maps API and JavaScript to display the locations of student’s co-op companies. Clicking the map points shows more details about the companies in that location. The map features a filter function that allows the user to filter the points on the map by location and industry.</p>\n\n<p><figure class=\"figure\">\n  <img src=\"../assets/temp/images/4/mapPanZoom.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Screenshot of the co-op map interactive article\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Screenshot of the co-op map interactive article</figcaption>\n</figure></p>\n\n<h4>Co-op industry visualization donut graph</h4>\n\n<p>The Co-op Industry donut graph is an interactive article I made in which users touch sections of a \"donut\" graph to see what percentage of our students get co-ops in that industry.</p>\n\n<p>This article uses JavaScript and D3.js to create the animations that occur when a user interacts with the graph. If the user chooses an industry that is related to another app story, the article will display a link to that story at the bottom of the page (shown at the end of the .gif below).</p>\n\n<p><figure class=\"figure\">\n<video class=\"gfy-video\" autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" playsinline=\"\" muted=\"\" poster=\"https://thumbs.gfycat.com/InformalQuaintCleanerwrasse-poster.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px;\"><source src=\"https://zippy.gfycat.com/InformalQuaintCleanerwrasse.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" class=\"webmsource\"><source src=\"https://zippy.gfycat.com/InformalQuaintCleanerwrasse.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" class=\"mp4source\"></video>\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Interactive 'donut' graph visual in action</figcaption>\n</figure></p>\n\n<h2>App store logistics</h2>\n\n<p>It was also my job to manage the app submission and distribution processes through the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. It's actually kind of hard! Managing the different licenses and certs you need to actually publish apps is pretty confusing if you are doing it for the first time.
