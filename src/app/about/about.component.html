                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>Currently, I am in an <strong>MBA program at the Rochester Institute of Technology</strong> in Rochester, New York, with an expected graduation date of May 2017. I am concentrating in management information systems.</p>
                <p>I received my undergraduate degree at the Rochester Institute of Technology, a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Media Arts and Technology</strong>. This major gave me the opportunity to explore different media fields such as programming, web design and development, page layout and design, typography, image retouching and composition, and print management.
                    <p>While taking classes in this undergraduate program I started to focus on web development, user interaction, variable data applications, and interactive visualizations.</p>

                <h2>Career Interests</h2>
                <p>I am interested in systems analysis and process improvement, and I am currently looking for positions in the web and software development industry. I want to help businesses implement projects and new solutions efficiently and correctly.</p>
                <p>As a developer, I am interested in working more with web frameworks and Node.js, and I am always interested in developing clean, lightweight solutions that donâ€™t include unnecessary dependencies.</p>

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>My experience so far is in web development: I started as a front-end developer working with mostly HTML/CSS/jQuery, but I have moved on to doing both front-end and back-end development, with a focus on JavaScript development.</p>
